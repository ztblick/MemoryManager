Things to be done:


Current goal:
- Implement all states of the state machines for PTEs and PFNs.
- Check that data is not lost in any transfer from the disk


Priority Sub-Goals:
- Resolve soft-fault issues: accurately remove pages from the middle of standby and modified lists
- Create a data structure for disk metadata
- Add disk, disk_map, and provide functionality for disk reads and disk writes

Sub-goals:
- Zero pages before assignment to new PTEs
- Initiate aging and trimming based on projections

BUGS:
- Unable to unmap all pages when exiting -- some VAs are left in memory format that are not linked to a page :(



~~~ OLD THOUGHTS THAT ARE SEEMINGLY IRRELEVANT ~~~

PAGE = 4k chunk of virtual memory
FRAME = 4k chunk of physical memory

- Implement PTE and PFN data structures:
    - Create PFN and PTE structs (DONE)
    - Create Page Table - 1-to-1 maps from 4k of VA space to each PTE (DONE)
    - Create page file (malloc to hold data written out to "disk") (DONE)

Bootup:
    - Create PFN_Array - mem reserve with virtual alloc (DONE)
    - call mem commit to allocate space for each physical page (DONE)
    - add all pages to free list (DONE)
    - initialize other list heads (DONE)
    - initialize page table (malloc) (DONE)
    - initialize page file (malloc) (DONE)


Things to figure out
    - how to map 4k of VA space to each PTE
    - how to find correct parameter for mapUser once I've found the offset of a page (from sparse array)?


Fault handler:
 - Figure out the specific order for this to be executed!


 First attempt:
 - No aging
 - Trim from active list from list head
 - unmap PTE
 - Write out to disk
 - update PTE
 - modify PFN
 - then serve page up to faulting VA


 What to do when we get a page fault?
 1. Grab the PTE for that VA (done)
 2. If the PTE is in disk format, then we know we need to load its contents from the disk. (NOT DONE)
 3. If the PTE is in transition, then (not yet possible, do not think about this yet)
 4. If the PTE is zeroed, then there is nothing to be done. (done)

 5. Get a page of memory by...
 6. First trying to get a page from the free list. If you can, great! Return the first PFN on the free list. (done)
 7. If the free list is empty, trim the first page from the active list: (done)

 - Unmap the old PTE to this page -- put it into disk format
 - Write the page out to the disk, saving its disk index
 - Add the disk index to the old PTE
 - Update the PFN's PTE to the new PTE

 K. Set the PTE into its memory format. Set the valid bit to 1 and save the frame_number. (done)
 L. Set the PFN to its active state and add it to the active list. (done)
 M. Call MapUserPhysicalPages() to make the connection. (done)

 Z. Read/write to the VA - no page fault this time!
